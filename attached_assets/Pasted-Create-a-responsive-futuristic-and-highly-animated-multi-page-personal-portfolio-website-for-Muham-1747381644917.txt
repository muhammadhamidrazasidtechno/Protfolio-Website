AI Chat Widget (Trained on CV)

Add a floating chat widget in the bottom-right corner, integrated with an AI model (preferably Gemini Free or another available LLM) trained on Muhammad Hamid Raza’s CV to answer questions about his skills, experience, education, and contact information.

Widget Requirements





Appearance:





Fixed chat icon (e.g., neon speech bubble) at bottom-right, always visible.



On click, open a chat window with:





Scrollable conversation area.



Message input field and send button (no name/email fields).



Close button (×) with smooth animation.



Use Tailwind CSS for styling and Framer Motion for open/close animations.



Ensure responsiveness for mobile and desktop.



Functionality:





Train the AI with the CV data to retain and recall details such as:





Skills: MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js, etc.



Experience: Sid Techno roles, responsibilities, and achievements.



Education: Government College of Commerce & Economics, Raza Foundation School.



Contact: Phone, email, GitHub, LinkedIn, location.



About Me: Passion for innovative, scalable web applications.



When users ask questions (e.g., “What are Hamid’s skills?”, “Tell me about his experience at Sid Techno”), the AI responds conversationally, pulling accurate details from the CV.



Maintain session-based message history (messages persist during the session).



Show a typing animation or loader while the AI processes the response.



Technical Implementation:





Frontend: Build the chat widget as a reusable Next.js component using Tailwind CSS and Framer Motion.



Backend: Create a secure API endpoint (e.g., /api/chat) in Next.js to handle AI requests. Store the API key in a .env file for security.



AI Integration: Use Gemini Free (or fallback to another LLM like OpenAI GPT if unavailable). Pass the CV data as context during initialization to “train” it for responses.



Training Approach:





Preload the CV text into the AI’s context or prompt at startup.



Structure the prompt to instruct the AI to act as a knowledgeable assistant about Muhammad Hamid Raza, answering only based on CV details.



Example AI instruction: “You are an AI assistant trained on Muhammad Hamid Raza’s CV: [Insert CV data]. Answer all questions accurately based on his skills, experience, education, and contact details. Respond conversationally and professionally. If a question is unrelated, say: ‘I’m here to share details about Muhammad Hamid Raza’s skills and experience. Ask me about his CV!’”



Storage: Use sessionStorage for chat history. Optionally, integrate Firebase Firestore for persistent storage, leveraging CV’s Firebase expertise.



Error Handling: For API errors (e.g., 404 or rate limits), display: “Oops, I’m having trouble connecting. Try again later!”



Technical Stack





Frontend: Next.js (App Router), React, Tailwind CSS.



Animations: Framer Motion, GSAP, Three.js, Spline, Particle.js.



Backend: Next.js API routes, Node.js for processing.



AI: Gemini Free (preferred) or another LLM, with CV data as context.



PDF Export: jsPDF + html2canvas.



Storage: SessionStorage for chat history, optional Firebase Firestore.



Tools: Git for version control, Vercel for deployment.



Deliverables





Complete Next.js project with all pages, components, and animations tailored to Muhammad Hamid Raza’s CV.



Fully functional AI chat widget integrated across all pages, trained on CV details.



Secure /api/chat endpoint with environment variables for API keys.



Documentation for running locally (e.g., npm install, npm run dev) and deploying to Vercel.



Instructions for updating CV data in the AI’s context if needed.



Notes





Ensure all website content (text, projects, skills, etc.) is derived from the CV to maintain consistency.



Test the AI with sample questions like:





“What does Muhammad Hamid Raza do?”



“Tell me about his work at Sid Techno.”



“What are his skills?”



“Where did he study?”



Align the chat widget’s design with the portfolio’s neon, futuristic aesthetic.



Leverage CV skills (e.g., Firebase, Socket.io, AWS) in the implementation, such as using Firebase for chat persistence or Socket.io for real-time updates.



If Gemini Free is unavailable, use a fallback LLM and document setup differences.
