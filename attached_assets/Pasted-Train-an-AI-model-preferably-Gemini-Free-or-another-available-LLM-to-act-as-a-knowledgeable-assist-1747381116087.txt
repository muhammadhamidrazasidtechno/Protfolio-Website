Configure the AI to respond only to questions about Muhammad Ibrahim’s CV, such as his skills, experience, education, certifications, or contact details.



Use a conversational tone, e.g., “Muhammad Ibrahim is a skilled front-end developer specializing in React.js and Next.js. He’s currently pursuing his graduation at IQRA University.”



If a question is unrelated to the CV (e.g., “What’s the weather?”), respond with: “I’m here to share details about Muhammad Ibrahim’s skills and experience. Ask me about his CV!”



Maintain session-based message history to allow follow-up questions during the user’s session.



For API integration (e.g., Gemini Free), pass the CV data in the initial prompt and secure the API key in a .env file, routing requests through a backend endpoint (e.g., /api/chat).



Test the AI with sample questions like:





“What are Muhammad Ibrahim’s skills?”



“Tell me about his experience at Sid Techno.”



“Where did he study?”
